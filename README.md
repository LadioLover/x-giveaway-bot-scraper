## How It Works
The bot follows a streamlined process to enter giveaways on your behalf:
**Input or Trigger** — User defines giveaway URL, credentials, and entry parameters.
**Core Logic** — The bot fetches the giveaway page, fills out entry forms, and submits the entry.
**Output or Action** — Entry submission is logged, and a success/failure notification is sent.
**Other Functionalities** — Proxy rotation, scheduling, and retry mechanisms are applied to ensure the bot runs smoothly across multiple sessions.
**Safety Controls** — Anti-bot measures are incorporated to avoid detection, including randomized delays, human-like actions, and proxy management.
